Serve self-contained distribution builds of `Swagger UI`_ and `Redoc`_ with `Django`_ either via `runserver`_ or `collectstatic`_.

This Django app is an optional addition to `drf-spectacular`_, but does not depend on it. It may also be used independently.

* `Swagger UI`_ version ``4.10.0`` (`npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist>`__)
* `Redoc`_ version ``2.0.0-rc.65`` (`npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/redoc>`__)

This is a self-updating and self-publishing repository that looks for updates once a week.
The distribution files are sourced from npm via `jsdelivr`_, validated, packaged and uploaded to `PyPI`_.

------------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install drf-spectacular-sidecar
