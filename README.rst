Serve self-contained distribution builds of `Swagger UI`_, `Redoc`_, and `Scalar`_ with `Django`_ either via `runserver`_ or `collectstatic`_.

This Django app is an optional addition to `drf-spectacular`_, but does not depend on it. It may also be used independently.

* `Swagger UI`_ version ``5.28.0`` (`npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist>`__)
* `Redoc`_ version ``2.5.0`` (`npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/redoc>`__)
* `Scalar`_ version ``1.28.32`` (`npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scalar/api-reference>`__)

This is a self-updating and self-publishing repository that looks for updates on the 1st of every month.
The distribution files are sourced from npm via `jsdelivr`_, validated, packaged and uploaded to `PyPI`_.
